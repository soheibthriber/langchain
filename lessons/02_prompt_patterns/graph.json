Next, define Machine Learning:\nMachine Learning is a subset of AI that concerns the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from experience and improve their performance on a given task without being explicitly programmed.\n\n3. Consider the relationship between AI and machine learning:\nMachine Learning is a key technology that enables the creation of intelligent machines mentioned in the definition of AI. Machine Learning is a fundamental component of AI, but not all AI uses machine learning.\n\n4. Identify the key aspects of AI that are not necessarily related to machine learning:\nSome AI systems rely on rule-based systems, knowledge representation, and logical reasoning to perform tasks, rather than machine learning.\n\n5. Consider the differences in approach:\nAI often involves designing systems from scratch to achieve a specific goal, whereas machine learning typically involves training models on existing data to achieve a specific outcome.\n\n6. Consider the complexity and scope:\nAI can encompass a wide range of disciplines, including machine learning, but it can also involve human-computer interaction, robotics, natural language processing, and more.\n\n7.
